Crypts & Caverns is a generative NFT project that can be used for on-chain game map configuration. This project powered by [CheDAO](https://twitter.com/CheDAOLabs). 

Crypts and Caverns is a generative, on-chain, Lootverse ‘lego’. Each NFT is programmatically generated within the contract, meaning no two maps are alike. The data within each map has been carefully optimized to play nicely within the loot ecosystem, supporting text, 2d, and 3d worlds. This means that developers, designers and artists alike can call the contract directly to integrate their own mechanics, adventures and tilesets on top.
